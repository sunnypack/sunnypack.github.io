								<h2>Summary of Products and Projects</h2>
								<h3>Electronics Device Case Study - Voltro</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/voltro.png" alt="" /></span> 
								Voltro is a 2 module DIN-rail mounted WiFi enabled energy monitoring and current sensing device with
								capabilities of switching 60 A at 240 VAC. It was the first product I had created as an electrical engineer and required knowledge of reflow soldering, surface mount assembly,
								WiFi integration, high to low voltage isolation and instrumentation, rigid-flex PCBs, interconnects and RCM/ACMA approval as a non-declared article. It was successfully deployed in over 200 homes in South Australia
								and NSW and is still in use today. During the launch of this product I had learned a lot about customer support, contractor and installer support, procurement and logistics and managing and mitigating risks.
								</p>
								<h3>Site Deployment Case Study - Grosvenor Tower</h3>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/grosvenor.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								This was one of the first corporate sites that were deployed. As this building was owned by the
								GPT group, there were some new challenges to meet such as meeting compliance requirements, liasing with contractors and suppliers to logistically arrive on time and on-site,
								making sure there was a coordinated effort for the site launch including but not limited to, printing signage, printing collateral, paint materials, electrical equipment and site
								assets, vehicle setup, API coordination, backend management, licensing and community approval, liasing and coordinating with building and facilities management, budgeting, 
								deadlines and larger style project management tools.
								</p>
								<h3>Site Maintenance Case Study - The Standard</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/standard.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								Due to inclement weather and rotating schedules a storm hit Brisbane, which housed one of our major residential deployments. At risk was over $ 300k AUD worth of equipment, labour
								and materials. I travelled on-site to tackle the challenges that came from imminent flooding. Luckily due to friendly relations with the developer and ongoing communication between
								the client, stakeholders and end users, residents experienced minimal disruption to their services with the risk being mitigated by moving the vehicles to safe locations and powering
								down non-essential equipment.
